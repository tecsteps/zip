## Features

### Feature 1: User Authentication

**Description:** Email/password authentication system for drivers and supervisors. Drivers can register and log in to submit damage reports. Supervisors have elevated permissions to review and approve reports.

**Scope:**
- User registration with email/password
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset flow
- Two user roles: Driver and Supervisor
- Role-based access control

---

### Feature 2: Driver Dashboard

**Description:** A simple, mobile-responsive dashboard where drivers can see their submitted reports, create new damage reports, and track the status of pending reports (Draft, Submitted, Approved).

**Scope:**
- List of driver's own reports with status indicators
- Quick action to create new report
- View individual report details
- Mobile-optimized layout

---

### Feature 3: Damage Report Creation

**Description:** The core feature where drivers submit damage reports. They upload a single photo of the damaged package, enter required information (Package/Shipment ID, Location/Address), and optionally add notes. Upon submission, the system triggers AI analysis.

**Scope:**
- Photo upload (single image, file upload - no camera integration)
- Required fields: Package/Shipment ID, Location/Address
- Optional field: Description/Notes
- Auto-captured fields: Driver name (from account), Date/Time (automatic)
- Report status starts as "Draft", moves to "Submitted" upon submission

---

### Feature 4: AI Damage Assessment

**Description:** Integration with OpenRouter to analyze uploaded damage photos using AI vision models. The AI assesses damage severity (minor/moderate/severe), damage type (crushed, wet, torn, etc.), estimated value impact, and liability assessment. Results are stored with the report.

**Scope:**
- OpenRouter API integration (model configurable via environment variable)
- Image analysis for damage assessment
- Structured output: severity category, damage type, value impact, liability
- Store AI assessment results with the report
- Handle API errors gracefully

---

### Feature 5: Supervisor Dashboard

**Description:** Dashboard for supervisors to review all submitted damage reports across all drivers. Supervisors can filter/search reports, view details, and approve or reject reports pending review.

**Scope:**
- List all reports (filterable by status, driver, date)
- View report details including photo and AI assessment
- Approve action (moves status to "Approved")
- Simple workflow: Submitted -> Approved (3-state model)

---

### Feature 6: Report View Page

**Description:** A professional web page displaying the complete damage report. This is the final output - a shareable, printable web page (not PDF) containing all report information, the damage photo, AI assessment results, and supervisor approval timestamp.

**Scope:**
- Clean, professional layout
- Dummy SVG company logo
- Report ID and date
- Package/shipment details
- Driver information
- Damage photo display
- AI assessment summary (severity, damage type, value impact, liability)
- Supervisor approval signature/timestamp
- Shareable URL
- Print-friendly styling
